## Used Materials / Packages / Pods

### `SDWebImage`

This library provides an async image downloader with cache support. For convenience, we added categories for UI elements like UIImageView, UIButton, MKAnnotationView.

### `Custom Solar System REST API`

Since no publicly available API had the things I needed, I decided to create my own and host it on Heroku. You can read more on the link below.

## Note

I plan on probably expanding the Project further in my free time.
